Shafii, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>The meeting opened on the morning of July 14, 2000 with program remarks from Chairperson, Rob Tempelman, followed by a welcome and overview by J. Ian Gray, Director, Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station. This was the technical portion of the program with a total of 25 participants.<\/p>\n<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s meeting was spatial statistical inference. John Castelloe, SAS Institute, presented a talk entitled: &#8220;SAS software tools for spatial statistical inference&#8221;. This was followed by a presentation given by Susanne Aref, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, regarding spatial statistical inference versus nearest neighbor analysis. Larry Douglass and Mary Christman, University of Maryland, presented case studies using SAS and S-plus for spatial statistical inference. Rich Alldredge, Washington State University, then gave a presentation on case studies of spatial dependence. Don Bullock, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, who was scheduled to give two presentations, was not able to attend the meeting due to illness.<\/p>\n<p>The technical meeting of July 14 started at 8:35 a.m. and ended at 5:10 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>The technical meeting continued on July 15 with another presentation by John Castelloe, SAS Institute, on analysis of spatial point patterns with an unknown number of clusters. The group then decided to call Don Bullock in Illinois to discuss issues related to precision agriculture. It was revealed that while another coordinating group dealing with precision agriculture (NCR-180) has been in existence for over five years, its continued efforts in this area have been questioned by the administrators, citing the lack of statistical application (expertise and support) as being the major criteria. NCR-170 can potentially assist the aforementioned group in areas such as spatial statistics and multivariate tools related to precision agriculture. Alternatively, the members can continue working on spatial statistical topics, picking up issues related to precision agriculture in the future. This will include presentations, publications and possibly conducting workshops.<\/p>\n<p>Linda Young, University of Nebraska-Lincoln then asked, &#8220;Where does NCR-170 go from here?&#8221;, a presentation requiring group participation and discussion. This also led to the start of the business meeting.<\/p>\n<p>The business meeting started at 10:10 a.m. Rob Tempelman chaired the session. Members were asked to identify potential areas in spatial statistics methods\/applications for future consideration (individual and group presentation\/the first dry-run of a workshop next year). The following areas were identified by the group: i) Design of spatial studies, ii) Analysis of designed experiments with spatial component, iii) Use of PROC MIXED to incorporate spatial patterns, iv) Sampling schemes in presence of spatial patterns, v) Creating maps, vi) Various estimation procedures, vii) Interface with GIS, viii) Prediction of spatial patterns, ix) Small sample considerations, x) Model diagnostics, xi) Analysis of non-normal data, xii) Degrees of freedom issues, xiii) Choice of covariance structure, and xiv) Modeling experimental vs observational studies. A number of teams (sub-groups) were then formed to concentrate on various aspects of the workshop, including introduction, design, estimation and analysis.<\/p>\n<p>The group welcomed the new administrative advisor, Cole Gustafson, North Dakota State University, as well as the new USDA representative, Larry Miller, USDA-CSREES, Washington, DC. Both Cole and Larry commended the members for their accomplishments. Cole suggested that the committee should consider creating a Web page for the upcoming year. This Web page would include information on NCR-170 goals and objectives, meeting times, past minutes and future plans, etc. He also urged the members to stress the importance of education and extension (or outreach, to use a better term) in their group discussion and activities. He complemented the group for their mid-term review, and suggested that topics related to precision agriculture may be included in the new proposal. It was decided that Linda Young and Larry Douglas would collaborate in writing the proposal with assistance from other members.<\/p>\n<p>It was agreed to hold the next NCR-170 meeting in Arkansas. This will be a joint meeting with the USSES group. Officers elected for next year are Ed Gbur (AR), Chair, and Bahman Shafii (ID), Secretary. It was tentatively agreed that Maryland would host the following annual meeting in the year 2002. South Dakota would host the NCR-170 annual meeting in the year 2003, as per groups&#8217; discussion and agreement.<\/p>\n<p>The meeting was adjourned at 11:30 a.m. on July 15, 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Submitted by:<\/p>\n<p>___________________________________<br \/>\nBahman Shafii, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>___________________________________<br \/>\nRob Tempelman, Chair<\/p>\n<p>___________________________________<br \/>\nCole Gustafson, Administrative Advisor<br \/>\n[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NCR-170: Research Advances in Agricultural Statistics Minutes of the meeting held July14-15, 2000, East Lansing, MI Official Members Present: E.
