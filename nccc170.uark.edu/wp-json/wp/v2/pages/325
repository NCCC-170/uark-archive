The purpose of the NCR-170 portion of the technical program was to provide an introduction to the theory and application of spatial statistics, leading to a discussion of technical issues that needed further research. Ultimately NCR-170 planned to develop a workshop on spatial statistics for agricultural scientists similar to their Mixed Model Workshop.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 2002, NCR-170 met in College Park, MD. The technical program addressed more advanced topics in spatial statistics, including initial reports on research being conducted by several committee members into statistical issues related to agricultural applications.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In 2003, the meeting was held in Reno, NV. In addition to technical presentations and research progress reports on various topics in spatial statistics, the committee discussed content, format and potential audiences for a spatial statistics workshop. A Workshop Subcommittee was formed and charged with the task of developing and presenting a \u201cdry run\u201d of a workshop as part of the 2004 technical program.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Accomplishments and impacts:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Statisticians who consult and do research in an Agricultural Experiment Station environment enable land grant institutions to perform their agricultural research missions more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise be possible. However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and can not be expected to be, experts in every area of statistics. This multi-state committee brings together statisticians to work cooperatively to determine the best current approaches to common statistical problems and to help guide future directions of sound statistical practice. It serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would without NCR-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Outputs: For the past three years, the NCR-170 meetings have focused primarily on educating its members in the general area of spatial statistics and initiating research into questions of fundamental importance to its application to agricultural problems ranging from traditional field experimentation to precision agriculture. This self-education phase is coming to an end with the development of a workshop for agricultural researchers to be used by NCR-170 members in a variety of educational settings.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In addition, committee members have reported the following project related activities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Invited session at the Joint Statistics Meetings (2001) entitled \u201cSpatial design and statistical issues in agronomy\u201d.

Recent developments in mixed models.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Impacts: At this point in time, the primary impact of NCR-170&#8217;s efforts in spatial statistics has been to educate its members who did not have previous expertise in the area and to motivate and conduct applied research to answer specific questions related to implementation in agricultural research settings. Outreach beyond the statistical community is just beginning.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>NCR-170&#8217;s Mixed Model Workshop has been well received by scientists working in a broad range of disciplines including agronomy, entomology, ecology and the animal sciences. In addition, committee members are incorporating mixed models into the education of the next generation of scientists through their formal and informal teaching activities at their institutions. Based on comments by NCR-170 members reviewing the statistical aspects of manuscripts for publication in subject matter journals, the use of mixed model methodology is becoming more common. Enabling researchers to use mixed models in analysis of variance routinely utilizes the full potential of current statistical methodology; NCR-170 is continuing to play a role in this process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a specific example of the impact, the collaboration between Bruce Craig and Alan Schinckel (see publications list) has resulted in a stochastic model and application of a systems approach to pork production which is being touted to Indiana producers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Specific goals for the next three years: (1) Develop and offer spatial workshops. For many agricultural research scientists spatial statistics is an unfamiliar topic. For such audiences, a workshop would necessarily begin with basic terminology and methodology and include examples of a variety of agricultural applications. For audiences with some background in spatial statistics, a more advanced set of topics of practical importance would be in order. (2) Develop methodology to address both spatial and general statistical problems in the area of precision agriculture. (3) Explore possible future directions for the project when our objectives relative to spatial statistics have been achieved; e.g., the statistical aspects of new techniques in agricultural genetics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Publications:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Meek, D.W.
