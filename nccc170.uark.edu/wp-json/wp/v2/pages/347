Gbur, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>There were 14 visitors, 8 from Nebraska and 6 from other states.<\/p>\n<p><b>Technical program:<\/b> July 8<\/p>\n<p>Following opening remarks by Chairperson Linda Young and a welcome by Dean Darrell Nelson (UNL), Donald Weeks (UNL Center for Biotechnology) presented an overview of the biotechnology field, including a brief history and several detailed examples of applications to the plant sciences. Bruce Weir (North Carolina State Department of Statistics) discussed statistical issues in the search for genes which affect quantitative traits. He used a research project involving Loblolly pine as an illustration. After lunch, Anne Parkhurst (UNL Department of Biometry) presented an introduction to fractal dimensions and its application to the problem of optimal sampling density. Chuck Francis (UNL Department of Agronomy) led a discussion of the research agenda for on-farm participatory research. He focused on the contrast between the researcher&#8217;s and farmer&#8217;s objectives. The final presentation was made by Walt Stroup (UNL Department of Biometry) on statistical issues related to on-farm experiments. Discussion centered on the use of mixed models to obtain site-specific predictions.<\/p>\n<p><b>Business meeting:<\/b> July 9<\/p>\n<p>Linda Young (NE) chaired the meeting.<\/p>\n<p>John Meadows reported that USDA has a new Assistant Secretary of Science and Education. He also reported that USDA will receive virtually no budget increase for 1993. Max Rothschild reviewed the objectives of an NCR and described the renewal process. The current NCR-170 will expire in 1993. Station reports were given by individual members. Since this was the first meeting for many representatives, reports tended to focus on a description of the structure of Statistics at the respective institutions.<\/p>\n<p>A lengthy discussion of the establishment of current project objectives followed the Station reports. It was decided that the group&#8217;s primary statistical focus would be in the area of on-farm trial methodology and that additional topics such as biotechnology would be secondary. Groups to work on specific aspects of the on-farm problem were formed (see attached list).<\/p>\n<p>Under the promotion of cooperative research and rapid transfer of technology, discussion centered on a journal for applied statistics in the biological and environmental sciences. A group headed by Linda Young is currently attempting to obtain American Statistical Association sponsorship for the journal. It was noted that other avenues would be explored if ASA support was not obtained. As a more long term goal, the group discussed the possibility of a workshop or short course in the area of statistical methods related to on-farm research.<\/p>\n<p>New officers were elected. Paul Hinz (IA) was elected chair and Ed Gbur (AR) was re-elected secretary. It was agreed to hold next year&#8217;s meeting in Iowa during the first half of July. Wisconsin was tentatively set as the site for the 1994 meeting.<\/p>\n<p>A writing committee was formed for renewal of the project for a second three year period.
