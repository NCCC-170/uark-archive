Ed Gbur presided. Bruce Craig and John Stevens were thanked for organizing a productive and enjoyable meeting. Minutes from the 2010 meeting were approved.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ed invited the speakers to send their presentations for posting on the project web site and all participants to send any photographs taken during the meeting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The following items were discussed:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0Julia Sharp presented a proposal from SCC-013 (USSES) to meet jointly with them next year at SAS Institute. Their meeting is tentatively scheduled for June 28-29, 2012. The content of the technical program was discussed. It was decided that if the SAS personnel associated with the development of GLIMMIX and their high performance module would give presentations, then NCCC-170 would be in favor of a joint meeting. Julia will find out if SAS is agreeable to this proposal and report back to the group sometime in August. Rob Tempelman agreed to host the 2013 meeting at Michigan State if we met jointly next year with USSES. If we do not meet jointly, the meeting at Michigan State would be held on July 12-13, 2012. Bruce Craig agreed to serve as program chair.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0Ed Gbur reported that the NCCC-170 was renewed for another five years, beginning October 1, 2011. The project number will be retained under the renewal. Current project members were not automatically rolled over into the renewed project. Anyone who has not filled out a new Appendix E to become an official member is encouraged to do so as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0The group reviewed and discussed specific goals for the next three years and impact statements. The annual report and impact statement are due shortly after the annual meeting. Participants need to send Ed (<a href=\"mailto:egbur@uark.edu\">egbur@uark.edu<\/a>) accountings of all activities (workshops, papers, presentations, teaching related items, etc.) from October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2011 (or since last year\u2019s report) that are related to or inspired by their participation in NCCC-170 as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(4)\u00a0Ed Gbur reported that the completed generalized linear mixed model monograph manuscript was sent to the Agronomy Society at the end of June. The title is \u201cAnalysis of Generalized Linear Mixed Models in the Agricultural and Natural Resources Sciences.\u201d Project members involved in the writing are Mary Christman, Susan Durham, Ed Gbur, Matt Kramer, Kevin McCarter, Walt Stroup, Mark West and Linda Young. Publication is scheduled to coincide with the Society\u2019s annual meeting in October.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The meeting adjourned at approximately 10:35 a.m. A group photograph for the project web site was taken immediately afterward.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Accomplishments: Statisticians who consult and do research in an Agricultural Experiment Station environment enable land grant institutions to perform their agricultural research missions more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise be possible. However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and can not be expected to be, experts in every area of statistics. This multi-state committee brings together statisticians to work cooperatively to determine the best current approaches to common statistical problems and to help guide future directions of sound statistical practice. In addition to producing group outputs such as workshops, the committee serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would be without NCCC-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Outputs:<\/p>\n<p>Workshops:<\/p>\n<p>Nora Bello, Bruce Craig and Rob Tempelman presented a &#8220;Mixed Model Workshop&#8221; at the Joint Annual Meeting of the American Dairy Science Association and the American Association of Animal Science in New Orleans in July 2011 (day and a half workshop).
