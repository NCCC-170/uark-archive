Ed Gbur presided. Kevin McCarter, Bert Bishop and Larry Madden were thanked for organizing a productive and enjoyable meeting. Ed noted that Bert is retiring and that the group will miss his participation but that he should follow the example set by Larry Douglass and feel free to attend future meetings. The following items were discussed:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0The status of the reorganization of the USDA is largely unknown.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0The group considered whether or not to make the technical presentations available to participants and, if so, in what form (i.e., emailed directly to participants or posted to the NCCC-170 website). Security limiting public availability for material available on the website is a concern. It was decided to add a password protected page to the project website to which speakers could voluntarily submit their presentations.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0Photos taken during the meeting will be posted on the website unless speakers notify Ed otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(4)\u00a0The 2009 meeting will be held in College Station, TX, at the USDA facility and hosted by Sara Duke. The date is tentatively set for sometime during the week of July 20-24. Sara will check on the availability of the facility. Mary Christman volunteered to serve as program chair.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(5)\u00a0Possible locations were discussed for the 2010 meeting. Rich Alldredge tentatively agreed to host the meeting in Washington. Meeting dates would be coordinated with the Joint Statistics Meetings in Vancouver.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(6)\u00a0The annual report is due shortly after the annual meeting. Participants need to send Ed (<a href=\"mailto:egbur@uark.edu\">egbur@uark.edu<\/a>) accountings of all activities (workshops, papers, presentations, teaching related, etc.) from October 1, 2007 to September 30, 2008 (or since last year\u2019s report) that are related to or inspired by their participation in NCCC-170 as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(7)\u00a0This year\u2019s annual report will serve as a summary of activities for the past three years for the project\u2019s mid-term review. The group reviewed last year\u2019s report and determined appropriate revisions of the review. Specific Goals (1), (3), (4), and (5) are ongoing. Goal (2) has been accomplished and no further work is needed. The series of papers on transitions from general linear models (GLM and MIXED procedures in SAS) to generalized linear models (GLIMMIX procedure in SAS) which are currently in development for submission to a peer-reviewed journal (e.g., Agronomy Journal) will be added to Specific Goals.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>For the Impact Nugget document, an item will be added to reflect the efforts of project members in organizing a Biometry Section in the Agronomy Society. Under Impacts, self-training (broadening expertise) will be added as a third point. Under Research Needs, the second bullet will be deleted, and an item addressing emerging technologies (e.g., precision agriculture, various \u201comics\u201d research) will be added, as will an item addressing the development of software tools in conjunction with the paper series.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ed will draft the mid-term report and send it to group members for review. He will need quick turnaround.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(8)\u00a0The deadline for drafts of papers for Agronomy Journal is November 15, 2008. Drafts will be sent to group members with the understanding that they are not to be distributed outside the group and that comments will be needed quickly. Reviewers should consider overlap and consistency of level among the papers.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The group thanked Ed for his leadership and, especially, report preparation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Announcements:<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0Mary Christman reminded the group about the Workshop on Environmetrics to be held October 22-24, 2008, at NCAR, Boulder, CO (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.stat.purdue.edu\/envr\/\">http:\/\/www.stat.purdue.edu\/envr\/<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0Larry Madden distributed a position announcement for Bert\u2019s replacement at OARDC.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The meeting adjourned at approximately 10:30 am.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Accomplishments: Statisticians who consult and do research in an Agricultural Experiment Station environment enable land grant institutions to perform their agricultural research missions more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise be possible. However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and can not be expected to be, experts in every area of statistics. This multi-state committee brings together statisticians to work cooperatively to determine the best current approaches to common statistical problems and to help guide future directions of sound statistical practice. In addition to group outputs such as workshops, it serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would without NCCC-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Outputs:<\/p>\n<p>Workshops:<\/p>\n<p>Rob Tempelman, Bruce Craig, Larry Douglass and Nora Bello presented a one and a half day mixed model workshop in July, 2008 at the Joint American Dairy Science Association \u2013 American Society of Animal Science Meetings in Indianapolis.

Application areas include biotechnology, precision agriculture and chemometrics. (2) Continue to develop methodology to address both spatial and general statistical problems in the area of precision agriculture. (3) Revise the mixed model workshop to include generalized linear mixed models and the use of new software. (4) Offer the mixed model workshop upon request from subject matter groups. (5) Publish a series of papers targeted to agricultural scientists on transitioning from general linear models (GLM and MIXED procedures in SAS) to generalized linear models (GLIMMIX procedure in SAS).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Impacts:<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NCCC-170 fosters research to identify and develop statistical methodology applicable to agricultural research and provides a forum for sharing and educating both statisticians and subject-matter scientists in the agricultural, environmental and natural sciences. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would without NCCC-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several members of NCCC-170 are also members of the American Society of Agronomy and its sister societies (Crop Science Society of America and Soil Science Society of America). Within the ASA, these members have been instrumental in the development of a new division devoted to the topics of biometry and statistics in the Tri-Societies. The goal of the Biometry Division is to provide a forum for members interested in statistics and experimental design from the research and\/or teaching points of view. The Division will serve as a resource and provide training for the larger tri-societies by sponsoring symposia and workshops on statistical techniques and experimental design at the national and regional meetings. It will also solicit review and methodology manuscripts for the society journals.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Publications:<\/p>\n<p>Aleong, C. and J. Aleong (2008).
