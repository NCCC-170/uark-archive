Dr. Pardini provided an overview of experiment station activities and highlighted the importance of statistics associated with these activities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Technical presentations for the morning were given by David Meek (\u201cNon-Stationarity and variogram fitting\u201d), Ed Gbur (\u201cSmall sample semi-variogram fitting\u201d ), Hao Zhang (\u201cSimulation study of variogram parameters\u201d), Sasha Kravchenko (\u201cInfluence of spatial statistics on accuracy of interpolation methods\u201d), Larry Douglass (\u201cComparison of kriging and mixed models for correlated data\u201d) and Rob Tempelman (\u201cPower assessments and space\u201d). Afternoon presentations were given by George Milliken (\u201cDesign of experiments to evaluate precision agriculture practices\u201d), Ted Bailey (\u201cFood science experiments and the implications of data-driven analyses\u201d), George Fernandez (\u201cApplications of non-parametric additive spline modeling in spatial data analysis\u201d), Matt Kramer (\u201cModels for spatially correlated binary data\u201d), John Aleong (\u201cHierarchical generalized models\u201d) and Jun Zhu (\u201cSpatial-temporal modeling of lattice data\u201d). The afternoon session ended at 4:40 pm.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Friday, July 11, 2003<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Friday\u2019s session began at 8:15 am with Ed Gbur requesting a report from each member of all NCR-170 related activities since January 1, 2001, including papers, presentations and workshops given or attended. This will used as the basis of the mid-term report which must be completed by December. He also asked that anyone who was willing to put their presentation at this year\u2019s meeting on the Members Only section of the NCR-170 web site to please forward the appropriate files to him. PDF files are preferred but other formats are acceptable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The group discussed whether or not they wished to have a joint meeting with USSES next year in St. Augustine, FL. It was unanimously agreed that we would meet next year with USSES as previously planned provided we could have a half-day joint session with USSES and a half-day separate session for a dry run of the spatial workshop. Contingent upon the St Augustine meeting not being feasible, the meeting will be held in Fort Collins, CO with Mark West as local host. If both the USSES and NCR-170 groups agree to have a joint meeting in 2004, the NCR-170 meeting for 2005 will be held in Fort Collins. Tentative dates for next year\u2019s meeting are July 8-9 with July 15-16 as a second choice. Bruce Craig agreed to serve as program chair for the 2004 meeting, regardless of where it is held.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The meeting proceeded at 9:05 with Larry Miller giving an administrative update. Dale Whittaker at Purdue is our new administrative advisor. Participants of NCR-170 who are not members are encouraged to become members. Larry requested feedback on the current state of affairs of statistics support at experiment stations in light of the increasingly tight budgets. Several members expressed decreased statistical support at experiment stations.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>At 9:15, George Milliken outlined a plan for a workshop to be born out of our efforts at NCR-170. George reported on a recent conference on precision agriculture attended by several NCR-170 members that provided a good basis for a workshop. The workshop would revolve around statistical support for experimentation in precision agriculture. The workshop would have three basic areas:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Site Characterization (this involves kriging and interpolation methods)<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Design of Experiments<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Data Analysis<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The group agreed that site characterization was a very important topic to cover and that this subject be the focus of next year\u2019s program. The group also agreed that a more general description of site characterization be \u201cBasics of Spatial Statistics.\u201d Bruce Craig, Mary Christman and Ed Gbur will co-chair the committee to develop this area of the workshop. Other committee members are John Aleong, George Fernandez, David Meek, Bahman Shafii, Mark West and Jun Zhu.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Other possible topics for next year\u2019s program were data management, sampling plans, modeling and predicting spatial variability, and software to provide these functions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>George Fernandez was thanked for providing an enjoyable meeting. The meeting adjourned at 10:45 am.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NCR-170 Research Advances in Agricultural Statistics Minutes of the meeting held July 10-11, 2003 at University of Nevada, Reno Official Members Present: J.
