It was decided to use these two topics for the next meeting. UNL volunteered to host the 1991-1992 meeting, scheduled for July 9-10, 1992. Linda Young said that she would be the chairperson and would guide the organization of the committee during 1991-1992 leading up to the meeting at UNL.<\/p>\n<p>It was decided that each group would encourage students to participate in the sessions at committee meetings with the intent of developing interest in applying statistics to solve problems in agriculture.<\/p>\n<p>As a future project, the publishing of a refereed journal in applied statistics was discussed with the possibility of developing such a journal as a regional publication. That possibility will be discussed again at later meetings.<\/p>\n<p>Ed Gbur was selected to be the secretary for the 1991-1992 committee. G. Milliken will send lists of designated members and copies of the NCR-170 proposal to Linda Young and Ed Gbur.<br \/>\n____________________________<br \/>\nChairperson 1990-1991<br \/>\n____________________________<br \/>\nAdministrative Advisor<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NCR-170: RESEARCH ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS Meeting held on April 28, 1991 at Manhattan, KS Present: Ed Gbur (AR), Linda Young (NE), Dave Marx (NE), Gary Krause (MO), George Milliken (KS), Max Rothschild (Administrative Advisor,IA), John Meadows (CSRS) Absent: W.
