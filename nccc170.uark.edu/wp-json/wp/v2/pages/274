NCR-170 met jointly with USSES (University Statisticians of Southern Experiment Stations) in Oklahoma City in 1998. We primarily revisited and revised the various mixed model workshop materials that were to be presented at the various societies. The only outside invited speaker was Dr. Bob Rodriguez from the SAS Institute to discuss the direction of SAS software at that time. NCR-170 then met in Urbana, IL, in 1999 to start establishing a new direction toward the applications of spatial statistics\/geostatistics in agriculture. Dr. Pierre Goovaerts from the University of Michigan and Dr. Konstantin Krivoruchko from ESRI discussed trends in methods and software for geostatistics. NCR-170 met in East Lansing, MI in 2000. John Castelloe was invited from SAS and gave a talk titled, &#8220;SAS Tools for Spatial Statistical Inference&#8221;. Topics of discussion centered around issues associated spatial correlated data and our continuing interest in mixed model methodologies. The committee will meet jointly with USSES in Arkansas in 2001 and in Maryland in 2002.<\/p>\n<p><b>Activities Update:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Over the past three years, the NCR-170 committee has focused particularly on exploiting the utility of mixed models and proper use of mixed model software to agricultural and natural resource research scientists and fellow statisticians at various professional society meetings throughout the country. A total of six mixed model workshops was organized by NCR-170 over that time frame. They are listed chronologically and briefly described below.

The current familiarity of particularly senior agricultural research scientists with mixed models is generally poor and will only be corrected with a sustained education and outreach effort. This is particularly important as graduate students are being instructed with mixed model methods, yet face challenges from graduate guidance committees and manuscript reviewers.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0 Explore spatial statistics as the next area of emphasis for the committee. Current efforts are aimed toward helping committee members understand classical issues (e.g. variography and its uses for describing and estimating biological processes) and the consideration of spatial concepts in designed experiments and geographic information systems. Our next meeting (2000) will focus on a critical evaluation of software that could be recommended for agricultural research scientists. This meeting will also provide a professional development opportunity for committee participants to sharpen their consulting toolbase in spatial statistics.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Highlights and Activities and Accomplishments since Last Approval Meetings: Since September, 1997, the NCR-170 committee has met three times.
