Technical presentations in the morning session were given by Rob Tempelman (\u201cMixed model analysis of microarray data: Some issues we\u2019re struggling with\u201d), Rich Alldredge (\u201cStructural equation modeling\u201d) and Mark West (\u201cAnalyzing spectroscopic data with methods of partial least squares\u201d). The theme of the afternoon session was statistical problems in precision agriculture. Presentations were given by Walt Stroup (\u201cMixed models and design of experiments\u201d), Jeff Willers (\u201cSpatial information in precision agriculture management of cotton\u201d) and George Milliken (\u201cUsing spatial information in the design and analysis of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of precision agricultural management systems\u201d &#8211; coauthored with Jeff Willers and Chuck O\u2019Hara). The afternoon session ended at 5:00 pm.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Business meeting: The business meeting began at 8:30 am on Friday, July 15 with Ed Gbur presiding. Mark West and George Milliken were thanked for providing an enjoyable meeting. The following items were discussed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0Next year\u2019s meeting will be held on July 13-14, 2006 at the University of Wisconsin with Jun Zhu as host and Don Bullock as Program Chair. The 2007 meeting, which may be joint with USSES, was tentatively scheduled for Utah. The 2008 meeting was tentatively scheduled for Ohio.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0It was decided that the NCR project label should be converted to NCCC to be consistent with the new national project labeling scheme.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0The Spatial Workshop given on the day after the Conference on Applied Statistics in Agriculture at Kansas State was discussed. There were approximately 25 attendees from Kansas State and USDA. Feedback from participants varied greatly and reflected the diverse backgrounds of the audience. A workshop proposal has been submitted to the Tri-Societies (ASA, CSSA, SSSA) for their 2006 annual meeting. Additional potential meetings at which the workshop could be presented were discussed and several people volunteered to contact the host societies. Disciplines included weed science, plant pathology, range science, agricultural engineering and precision agriculture. The spatial workshop committee will continue to revise the content and possibly add a spatial point process module.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(4)\u00a0Larry Miller presented a report on CSREES staffing, program reviews and the current status of the FY2006 budget.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(5)\u00a0Project members were reminded to send their contributions for the accomplishment, output and impact sections of the annual report to Ed Gbur (<a href=\"mailto:egbur@uark.edu\">egbur@uark.edu<\/a>) as soon as possible. The target completion date for the report is mid-August so as to avoid the beginning of fall semester and the project renewal process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(6)\u00a0The current project is due to expire on Sept. 30, 2006. The renewal process will take place this fall. The deadline for each step in the renewal was discussed. Members were reminded that a new Appendix E form will need to be filed to retain membership on the renewed project. The writing committee will consist of Bruce Craig, Ed Gbur and Rob Tempelman.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(7)\u00a0The group discussed topics which would be included in the renewal. It was decided to continue with mixed models and spatial statistics, especially as they relate to statistical modeling of agricultural systems. Discussion then focused on the increasing number of collaborative projects in which large the numbers of variables are collected on very few experimental units and traditional statistical analyses are often not applicable. Examples of such application areas include biotechnology, precision agriculture and chemometrics. It was decided that the new focus would be on this type of statistical problem. The current project proposal was reviewed with discussion centering on using it as the basis of the renewal proposal.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The meeting adjourned at approximately 11:00 am.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Accomplishments and impacts: Statisticians who consult and do research in an Agricultural Experiment Station environment enable land grant institutions to perform their agricultural research missions more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise be possible. However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and can not be expected to be, experts in every area of statistics. This multi-state committee brings together statisticians to work cooperatively to determine the best current approaches to common statistical problems and to help guide future directions of sound statistical practice. In addition to group outputs such as workshops, it serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would without NCR-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The highly successful mixed model workshop developed by project members continues to be offered at regional and national subject matter meetings. The newly developed spatial statistics workshop has been offered for the first time and proposals will be submitted to several subject matter professional societies to offer the workshop at their annual meetings.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>As a result of the development of the mixed model workshop, several project members with teaching responsibilities have revised their experimental design classes to include mixed model analysis of variance methodology and the associated data analysis using SAS. These members include Rich Alldedge, Ted Bailey and Ed Gbur. Such revisions help train the next generation of scientitsts using the most recent advances in statistical methodology.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Outputs: The spatial statistics workshop was presented to a group of 25 Kansas State University and USDA scientists in Manhattan, Kansas in April 2005 by Ed Gbur, Jun Zhu and Mary Christman. Contacts are being made with several subject matter societies to offer the workshop in conjuction with their annual meetings.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In addition, committee members have reported the following project related activities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Selected presentations at the 2004 Kansas State University Conference on Applied Statistics in Agriculture by:<\/p>\n<p>Meek, D.W. and M.D. Tomer. Characterizing the discharge distribution from small agricultural watersheds.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Zhu, J. and G. Morgan. Nonparametric block bootstrap for analyzing repeated-measures and spatially correlated data.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Poster presentation entitled \u201cRecommendations for fitting log profile data\u201d by D.W. Meek at the 2004 American Society of Agronomy annual meetings.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Several project members have become involved with the USDA-ARS Precision Agriculture group.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ed Gbur spent his sabbatical leave in the Statistics Department at the Ohio State University working with Noel Cressie (OSU) and Yongtao Guan (University of Miami) to develop methodology to analyze spatial point processes on cylinders and truncated cones. The research was motivated by collaborative work between Ed Gbur and entomologists at the University of Arkansas to model the spatial attack patterns of red oak borers on oak trees.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ed Gbur is a member of an interdisciplinary team of scientists at the University of Arkansas for a project entitled \u201cEffectiveness and optimization of BMPs in improving water quality from an agricultural watershed\u201d which was funded by USDA-CAEP. A portion of the project will involve the analysis of spatial data.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Bruce Craig served as chair of the Purdue School of Science Spatial Statistics Search Committee. He was also named Director of the Purdue University Statistical Consulting Service and a University Faculty Scholar.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rich Alldredge provided complex mixed model analyses for the Spokane County Direct Seeding Project. The project was funded by USDA-SARE to Washington State University Extension Service.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rich Alldredge served as an external reviewer for a proposed project entitled \u201cEstimation and Calibration of Dose-Response Functions\u201d for the Idaho Agricultural Experiment Station. The project will involve mixed model analysis of variance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Specific goals for the next three years: (1) Educate project members in statistical issues and methodology related to statistical problems in which large number of variables are collected on relatively few experimental units. Application areas include biotechnology, precision agriculture and chemometrics. (2) Develop additional modules for spatial workshops, refine the current modules and offer versions tailored to specific subject matter audiences. (3) Continue to develop methodology to address both spatial and general statistical problems in the area of precision agriculture. (4) Continue to offer the mixed model workshop upon request from subject matter groups.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Publications:<\/p>\n<p>Ives, A.R. and J. Zhu (2005).
