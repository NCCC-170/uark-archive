All of them are text files. The first few lines of each file provide information on its contents. No SAS coding has been provided. Some files contain modified versions or subsets of data that were used in publications. The modifications were made to enable us to illustrate specific concepts and issues. As stated in the book, they are not intended to be the basis for drawing subject matter conclusions but rather to demonstrate the wide range of research settings to which generalized linear mixed models can be applied. A few files are part of ongoing research projects and\/or manuscripts under consideration for publication. Additional files will be added as they become available.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example3-4.docx\">Example 3-4: Soil nitrogen measurement methods<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example4-1.docx\">Example 4-1 Fictitious data for the conditional and marginal model discussion<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example4-3.docx\">Example 4-3: Mean leaf area per leaf for soybean lines<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example4-5.docx\">Example 4-5: Calcium concentration in the soil profile<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example4-6.docx\">Example 4-6: Yield \u2013 test weight relationship in wheat<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example5-6.docx\">Example 5-6: Tillage effect on purple nutsedge tuber production<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example5-7.docx\">Example 5-7: Mummy berry fruit rot in blueberries<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example5-8.docx\">Example 5-8: Ammonia volatilization from urea<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example5-9.docx\">Example 5-9: Restoration of Nebraska Sand Hills<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example5-13.docx\">Example 5-13: Fictitious data for the over-dispersion discussion <\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example5-15.docx\">Example 5-15: Cotton seedling fungicide study<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/files\/2017\/01\/Example5-20.docx\">Example 5-20: Stink bug damage to soybean pods<\/a><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Data Files for Selected Examples Data files from the generalized linear mixed model book are provided here to allow readers to recreate the analyses of the examples in the book.
