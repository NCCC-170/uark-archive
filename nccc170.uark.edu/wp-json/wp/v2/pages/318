The theme of the morning session was the statistical aspects of microarray experiments. Technical presentations were given by Bruce Craig (\u201cStatistical issues\u201d), Rob Templeman (ADesign issues\u201d), and Dan Nettleton (\u201cExamples of data analysis\u201d). The afternoon session was devoted to a dry run of the spatial data workshop which is being developed by NCR-170. Presentations were given by Ed Gbur (\u201cBasics of spatial data@), Bruce Craig (\u201cAnalysis of lattice data@ and \u201cDesign in spatial experiments,\u201d the latter with Jun Zhu), and Mark West (\u201cCombining multi-scale spatial data\u201d). The afternoon session ended at 5:15 pm.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Tuesday=s technical session began at 8:30 am with a presentation by Jamie Baldwin (\u201cWhat does the Kenwood-Roger option do?\u201d). The remainder of the session consisted of spatial workshop presentations by David Meek (Screening procedures for databases\u201d) and John Aleong (\u201cQuality control methods for spatial data\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Business meeting: The business meeting began at 10:00 am with Ed Gbur presiding. Ramon Littell was thanked for providing an enjoyable meeting. The following items were discussed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0Suggestions for a new administrative advisor were requested.<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0Participants who wish to become official members were reminded that they need to file the necessary paperwork.<\/p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0The midterm report has been replaced by required annual reports which must follow a prescribed format, including a list of project activities, outputs, accomplishments and impacts. Ed requested all participants forward information to him regarding their recent activities.<\/p>\n<p>(4)\u00a0The 2005 meeting will be held in Fort Collins on July 14 and 15 with Mark West as host. George Milliken agreed to serve as program chair. One objective of next year\u2019s program will be to introduce potential new topics for the project. Suggested topics of interest to members were given to George. The 2006 meeting will be hosted by Jun Zhu at the University of Wisconsin.<\/p>\n<p>(5)\u00a0George Fernandez suggested that a news-group\/discussion board type web site be established for NCR-170 members to interact during the year. Mark Hinds agreed to set up and maintain such a site.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The discussion then turned to the spatial workshop. Members provided feedback to the speakers and suggestions on how they might modify their presentations to match audience background. It was agreed that the workshop would be developed as a series of modules to allow it to be tailored to the needs of various subject matter audiences. The possibility of creating a CD containing a set of worked out spatial data analyses to be used in conjunction with the workshop was discussed. We probably could not sell such a CD separately because of copyright issues but it might be possible to give it to workshop attendees with production costs included as part of the workshop fee. George Milliken suggested that the workshop might be given to a subject matter audience in conjunction with next year\u2019s Kansas State Conference on Applied Statistics in Agriculture. George would need a commitment by January at the latest. It was decided to set up an ftp site where draft versions of the modules would be available for feedback directly to the authors from project members during the year. Ed Gbur agreed to set up such a site. Finally, it was decided that the workshop would not be presented as part of next year\u2019s technical program.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The meeting adjourned at approximately 11:30 am.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Accomplishments and impacts: Statisticians who consult and do research in an Agricultural Experiment Station environment enable land grant institutions to perform their agricultural research missions more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise be possible. However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and can not be expected to be, experts in every area of statistics. This multi-state committee brings together statisticians to work cooperatively to determine the best current approaches to common statistical problems and to help guide future directions of sound statistical practice. In addition to group outputs such as workshops, it serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would without NCR-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The highly successful mixed model workshop developed by project members continues to be offered at regional and national subject matter meetings.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Outputs: The self-education phase in spatial statistics has essentially ended with the dry run of the workshop at the project\u2019s annual meeting. The workshop will be offered to subject matter audiences within the next year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In addition, committee members have reported the following project related activities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mixed model workshop presented at:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>2004 Federation of Animal Science Societies annual meeting in St. Louis by Rob Tempelman, Larry Douglass and Bruce Craig.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Department of Plants, Soils and Biometeorology at Utah State in December 2003 by Susan Durham.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>USDA-ARS researchers in Logan, Utah in February 2004 by Mark West and Susan Durham. Logistic regression was also included in the workshop.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>USDA-ARS researchers and Utah State faculty in April 2004 by Susan Durham with emphasis on repeated measures.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Workshop entitled \u201cLinear and nonlinear models for correlated data\u201d presented at the 2004 Wildlife Society annual meeting in Calgary.

(2) Develop methodology to address both spatial and general statistical problems in the area of precision agriculture. (3) Continue to offer the mixed model workshop upon request from subject matter groups.
