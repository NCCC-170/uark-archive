Gbur, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>There were 21 visitors, 16 from Iowa and 5 from other states.<\/p>\n<p><b>Technical Program:<\/b> July 15 &amp; 16<\/p>\n<p>The meeting opened on the morning of July 15 with remarks from Chairperson Paul Hinz and a welcome by Dean David Topel (ISU). The theme for the entire program was &#8220;on-farm trials.&#8221; Walt Stroup (UNL) presented a talk on basic considerations in on-farm trials. This laid a conceptual framework for the topic. Dallas Johnson (KSU) followed with a presentation on the analysis of non-replicated two-way experiments with applications to on-farm trials. This presentation included practical thoughts on analysis. A third talk discussed applications on on-farm research conducted by a seed company, Oscar Smith (Pioneer). This talk focused on the use of on-farm trials by Pioneer.<\/p>\n<p>The afternoon consisted of field trips to two sites related to on-farm trials. The first was the Ames Water Pollution Control Facility. The emphasis here was on treating waste material to allow plant growth. The second was on the Risdahl Farm. On this farm, tree plantings around a stream were used to minimize difficulties such as run-off from fields and erosion.<\/p>\n<p>On the morning of July 16, David Marx (UNL) led a discussion on the content of a short course on statistical issues in on-farm trials. The main purpose was to organize the topics for the short course and to assemble teams of individuals for preparing materials on the various topics. The plan was for a 1\u00bd day workshop with approximately 1\/3 of the time spent on &#8220;lectures&#8221; and 2\/3 on &#8220;hands-on participation&#8221; by course attendees. The material was divided into three portions. The University of Nebraska will serve as the central focus with David Marx as the overall coordinator.<\/p>\n<p><b>Business meeting:<\/b> July 16<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Station reports were given by individual members. Common themes were budget problems and personnel changes at the various Experiment Stations.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A report from John Meadows, CSRS, was given by Max Rothschild. He suggested that the CSRS budget situation was pretty good. Formula funding seemed likely to hold stable with more funding for minority participation. It appears likely that there will be some downsizing of ARS.<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Max Rothschild gave a positive review of the development of NCR-170. He felt positive about the sense of focus. He suggested that membership increase might be encouraged, possible from outside the region. He indicated that he was likely to leave his current post on July 1, 1994.<\/p>\n<p>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Dallas Johnson (KSU) indicated the current status of the new journal on statistical applications to agriculture, biology, and the environment. The journal was well on-track but there were still some uncertainties on the name and on timing.<\/p>\n<p>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plans were discussed for future meetings. The 1994 meeting will take place in Madison, WI on July 7 and 8. The program will by a &#8220;dry-run&#8221; for the short course on on-farm trials with the audience composed of members not directly involved in course preparation and a small number of invitees. It is anticipated that the 1994 meetings may run a bit closer to 2 days in order that useful feedback on the short course can be obtained from participants. It was proposed to hold the 1995 meetings joint with USSES. The new officers elected for 1994 were Chair- Rick Nordheim (WI) and Secretary- Ed Gbur (AR).<br \/>\n________________________<br \/>\nChair<br \/>\n________________________<br \/>\nAdministrative Advisor<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NCR-170: RESEARCH ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS Minutes of the meeting held July 15-16, 1993 at Ames, IA Members Present: G.
