Their multi-disciplinary collaborative role is generally much more extensive than that of other faculty within the University. This increased level of collaboration allows Land Grant institutions, through the use of Experiment Station statisticians, to perform their agricultural research mission more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise be possible. As State and Federal appropriations and grants continue to fall short of funding levels needed for research, it becomes even more imperative that research dollars go farther. This requires that Experiment Station statisticians continually keep abreast of the latest statistical research as well as work to develop methodology appropriate to their consulting roles.<\/p>\n<p>Since most states have only one or two statisticians assigned full time to the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Station statistician works somewhat in isolation. However, the statistical problems which each one faces, once extracted from their subject matter applications, have a great deal in common. Thus, it is useful for Station statisticians to meet and solve difficult common statistical problems jointly and to discuss approaches taken by their counterparts in other states in similar situations. In addition, anticipated statistical problems of importance to their respective subject matter collaborators can be delineated and addressed in advance. In this respect, Experiment Station statisticians can work together to provide more effective assistance to the agricultural researchers of their respective states. An NCR committee can play an extremely important role by serving as a focal point for the development and implementation of sound statistical practice.<\/p>\n<p><b>IV.\u00a0 Committee Objectives<\/b><\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To promote cooperative research efforts among statisticians with interests in agricultural applications. To explore current as well as anticipated statistical problems of mutual interest and potential approaches to their solutions.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To develop sound statistical methodology for the design and analysis of on-farm trials research. To promote the use of such methodology through workshops and\/or short courses for agricultural researchers.<\/p>\n<p>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To facilitate more rapid transfer of new statistical methodology to agricultural researchers. This objective could potentially involve collaboration with other Regional committees where substantive statistical input would enhance research programs.<\/p>\n<p><b>V.\u00a0\u00a0 State and Active Participants<\/b><br \/>\n<center><\/p>\n<table width=\"65%\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>E.

It was attended by only 4 official members, 2 administrators, and 1 visitor and served primarily as an organizational meeting.<\/p>\n<p>The second meeting of NCR 170 was held in Lincoln, NE in July 1992. It was attended by 12 of the 16 official members, 2 administrators, and 14 visitors, all of whom participated actively in the discussions. The technical program consisted of sessions on statistics in biotechnology and on on-farm trials statistical methodology. It became clear from these sessions that sound, comprehensive methodology does not currently exist in either of these areas.<\/p>\n<p>At the business meeting it was decided that the group&#8217;s primary focus would be in the area of on-farm trials. Work groups to deal with specific aspects of the general on-farm trials problem were formed. (The membership list for each group was given in the minutes of the meeting.) It was agreed that as methodology was developed, it would be disseminated through short courses and\/or workshops. Refereed journal papers and\/or a methodology handbook were viewed as more long term goals.<\/p>\n<p>A group headed by L. Young (NE) described their efforts to obtain American Statistical Association (ASA) sponsorship of a new (refereed) journal for applied statistics in the agricultural, biological and environmental sciences. At its August 1992 meeting, the ASA Board of Directors approved sponsorship of such a journal and is currently in the process of selecting an editor. It is hoped that the journal will publish its first issue within two years.<\/p>\n<p><b>VII.\u00a0\u00a0 Recommendation of NCA Committee(s)<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The revision of NCR-170 was reviewed by the NCA 6-7-8 and NCA 1-9. All NCA committees were supportive of this project. NCR 1-9 noted that NCR-170 is &#8220;based on sound scientific merit. This committee will play an important role as a focal point for the development and implementation of sound practices in our region&#8221;. NCA 6-7-8 will continue to monitor NCR-170 and has assigned a liaison to the NCR-170 committee.<\/p>\n<p><b>VIII.\u00a0\u00a0 Required Signatures<\/b><\/p>\n<p>________________________________<br \/>\nNCR Committee Chair<br \/>\n________________________________<br \/>\nAdministrative Advisor<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NCR 170: RESEARCH ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS II.\u00a0\u00a0 Duration: October 1, 1993 through September 30, 1997 III.\u00a0 Justification Statisticians who consult and do research in an Agricultural Experiment Station environment have a unique relationship with the University.
