Shafii, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>The meeting opened on the morning of July 13, 1995 with program remarks from Chairperson Gary Richardson, followed by a welcome by Wilbert Blackburn, Northern Plains Area Director, USDA\/ARS. This was the first joint meeting of NCR-170 and USSES (SRIEG-13) with a total of 32 participants. While the technical program included members from both groups, it was agreed that each group would hold a separate business meeting.<\/p>\n<p>The featured speaker was Franklin Graybill from Colorado State University. He presented a talk entitled &#8220;A Review&#8221;, covering such topics as surveys, experimental studies, estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and p-value. He offered his personal view (philosophy) regarding these topics and emphasized the role of statisticians in relaying such basic concepts to their students and\/or clients. This was followed by a brief discussion session with Dr. Graybill.<\/p>\n<p>The afternoon portion of the technical program was devoted to rectangular table discussions. Topics selected included generalized linear models, mixed model analysis, spatial statistics, and categorical and non-normal data. Each topic was reviewed and discussed in detail by the members in each respective group. This was followed by group presentations and discussions. Members collectively agreed that the specified topics and format of discussion were beneficial.<\/p>\n<p>The technical program started at 8:35 a.m. and ended at 5:10 p.m. July 13, 1995.<\/p>\n<p>The morning of July 14 was devoted to touring the National Seed Storage Laboratory located on the campus of Colorado State University. Steve Eberhart gave a presentation emphasizing the background, objective, and mission of the unit, while Eric Ross provided a more technical description of plant germplasm preservation. Some of the current research projects were also briefly reviewed at this time. The participants were then divided into two groups for the actual tour of the facilities. The entire tour was most interesting and educational.<\/p>\n<p>The noon and early afternoon hours were used for a business meeting. Gary Richardson chaired the session. It was agreed to hold the next NCR-170 meeting in Indiana (Purdue University). Officers elected for next year are: Wyman Nyquist (IN), Chair, and Bahman Shafii (ID), Secretary. A tentative date of July 11-12, 1996 was agreed upon by the members. Don Sisson agreed to host the 1997 meeting at Utah State University.<\/p>\n<p>The subject of documenting\/publishing the &#8220;On-farm Trials&#8221; short course was brought up. It was suggested to have Dallas Johnson prepare the first draft (by December 1996) with inputs from Walter Stroup, George Milliken, and Brian Yandell. It was further agreed to have Dave Marx put together the final draft after. soliciting review comments from other members. Some possible formal publication outlets were suggested; however, no consensus was reached.<\/p>\n<p>Some members suggested a change in the format of NCR-170 from a &#8220;coordinating research committee&#8221; to that of an &#8220;information exchange committee&#8221;. Although the latter seemed more appealing (due to diversity of research interests among members as well as different geographical locations), the majority of members agreed to a &#8220;common theme&#8221; research activity and a collective publication\/distribution of such research results. The theme for next year&#8217;s meeting (and therefore, the focus of NCR-170&#8217;s future task) was agreed to be generalized linear models.<\/p>\n<p>The business meeting started at 11:15 am. and ended at 12:40 p.m., July 14, 1995.<\/p>\n<p>Submitted by:<\/p>\n<p>__________________________________________<br \/>\nBahman Shafii, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>__________________________________________<br \/>\nGary Richardson, Chair<\/p>\n<p>__________________________________________<br \/>\nDon Holt, Administrative Advisor<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NCR-170: Research Advances in Agricultural Statistics Minutes of the Meeting Held July 13-14, 1995, Fort Collins, CO Members present: E.
