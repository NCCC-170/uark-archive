Kathy Yeater will serve as program chair. The USSES group (SCC-13) will be invited to meet jointly next year. Kevin McCarter will serve as the contact person. Bruce Craig volunteered to host the 2011 meeting at Purdue.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0The group reviewed and discussed specific goals for the next three years and impacts. The annual report and impact statement are due shortly after the annual meeting.

Don Bullock and Kathy Yeater will approach the Tri-Societies (Agronomy, Crop Science and Soil Science) to determine if they would be interested in publishing the monograph. If they are not interested, another publisher would be sought.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ed Gbur agreed to coordinate the writing and to edit the final draft to ensure consistency of style and notation throughout the monograph.

However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and can not be expected to be, experts in every area of statistics. This multi-state committee brings together statisticians to work cooperatively to determine the best current approaches to common statistical problems and to help guide future directions of sound statistical practice. In addition to group outputs such as workshops, it serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would without NCCC-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Outputs:<\/p>\n<p>Workshops:<\/p>\n<p>Rob Tempelman, Bruce Craig and Larry Douglass presented a one and a half day mixed model workshop in July, 2009 at the Joint American Dairy Science Association \u2013 American Society of Animal Science \u2013 Canadian Society of Animal Scienc Meetings in Montreal.

The section serves as a resource and provides training for the larger Tri-Societies\u2019 membership by sponsoring symposia and workshops at the national and regional meetings.
