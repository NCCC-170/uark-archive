Gbur, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>There were 4 visitors from Wisconsin who served as &#8220;students&#8221; for the workshop.<\/p>\n<p><b>Technical program:<\/b> July 7-8<\/p>\n<p>The technical program on July 7 and the morning of July 8 consisted of a &#8220;dry-run&#8221; of the on-farm trials workshop being developed by NCR-170 and related group discussion. The principal presentations were made by Walt Stroup, Brain Yandell, and Dallas Johnson. The technical portion of the program ended with brief presentations on a number of areas which might serve as optional topics for the workshop.<\/p>\n<p>Group discussion included duration of the workshop, intended audience, technical level, use of computers, inclusion of additional topics, and written material to accompany the workshop. Future presentations at subject matter professional meetings and by members at their home institutions was discussed. It was agreed to look into the possibility of one more practice run using the Ag satellite network rather than having another meeting. Ben Jones indicated that there may be funding sources to help defray the cost of using the network.<\/p>\n<p><b>Business meeting:<\/b> July 8<\/p>\n<p>Rick Nordheim (WI) chaired the meeting. Officers elected for next year are Gary Richardson (USDA), chair and Bahman Shafii (ID), secretary. It was agreed to hold next year&#8217;s meeting in Colorado during the middle of July. Some sessions would be held jointly with USSES (SRIEG-13). Gary Richardson will work with them to determine the exact time, format and topics. Our primary topic of interest was the analysis of categorical data. Wyman Nyquist agreed to host the 1996 meeting at Purdue.<br \/>\n________________________________<br \/>\nChair<br \/>\n________________________________<br \/>\nAdministrative Advisor<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NCR-170: RESEARCH ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS Minutes of the meeting held July 7-8, 1994 at Madison, WI Members Present: E.
