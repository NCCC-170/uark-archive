NCR-170 met jointly with USSES (University Statisticians of Southern Experiment Stations) in Oklahoma City in 1998. We primarily revisited and revised the various mixed model workshop materials that were to be presented at the various societies. The only outside invited speaker was Dr. Bob Rodriguez from the SAS Institute to discuss the direction of SAS software at that time. NCR-170 then met in Urbana, IL, in 1999 to start establishing a new direction towards the applications of spatial statistics\/geostatistics in agriculture. Dr. Pierre Goovaerts from the University of Michigan and Dr. Konstantin Krivoruchko from ESRI discussed trends in methods and software for geostatistics. Minutes for these meetings are attached with this report. The committee will meet again in East Lansing, MI in 2000 and will jointly meet with USSES in Arkansas in 2001.<\/p>\n<p><b>Activities Update:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Over the past two years, the NCR-170 committee has focused particularly on expositing the utility of mixed models and proper use of mixed model software to agricultural and natural resource research scientists and fellow statisticians at various professional society meetings throughout the country. A total of six mixed model workshops were organized by NCR-170 over that time frame. They are listed chronologically and briefly described below.

Continue to develop and offer mixed model workshops. The current familiarity of particularly senior agricultural research scientists with mixed models is generally poor and will only be corrected with a sustained education and outreach effort. This is particularly important as graduate students are being instructed with mixed model methods, yet face challenges from graduate guidance committees and manuscript reviewers.<\/p>\n<p>2. Explore spatial statistics as the next area of emphasis for the committee. Current efforts are aimed toward helping committee members understand classical issues (e.g. variography and its uses for describing and estimating biological processes) and the consideration of spatial concepts in designed experiments and geographic information systems. Our next meeting (2000) will focus on a critical evaluation of software that could be recommended for agricultural research scientists. This meeting will also provide a professional development opportunity for committee participants to sharpen their consulting toolbase in spatial statistics.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Midterm Report for NCRA Multistate Research Committee January, 2000 Project: NCR-170 (Cooperators: IL, IN, IA, KS, MI, MO, NE, SD, WI, AR, ID, KY, OK, UT, WA, USDA) Title: Research Advances in Agricultural Statistics Timeline of Current Project: October 1, 1997-September 30, 2001 Objectives: 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To identify, foster, and coordinate cooperative research efforts among statisticians [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":44,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/333"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/44"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=333"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/333\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=333"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
