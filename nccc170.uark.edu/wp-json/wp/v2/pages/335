Shafii, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>The meeting opened on the morning of July 22, 1999 with program remarks from Chairperson, Don Bullock, followed by a welcome and overview by Richard Warner, Associate Dean, College of Agriculture. This was the technical portion of the program with a total of 36 participants.<\/p>\n<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s meeting was geostatistics. Pierre Goovaerts, University of Michigan, presented a talk entitled &#8220;Environmental geostatistics: State-of-the-art and perspective&#8221;. This was followed by a presentation given by Linda Young, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, regarding various problems encountered by statistical consultants. Konstantin Krivoruchko, ESRI, then gave a presentation on geostatistical tools for GIS.<\/p>\n<p>The technical meeting of July 22 started at 8:35 a.m. and ended at 4:50 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>Due to unavailability of some of the members for the business meeting, originally scheduled for Friday, July 23 (10:30 &#8211; 12:00), it was decided to hold the aforementioned meeting following the technical program of July 22nd. The business meeting started at 5:00 p.m; Don Bullock chaired the session. Members were reminded that NCR-170 would require a midterm report (review) prior to January 1, 2000. To do this, the administrative advisor will need copies of all minutes, a list of material put together by the members, workshops conducted, speakers invited, agendas for meetings, and goals statements for the next two years. The report should be about three pages in length. It was suggested that Rob Tempelman (with help from Larry Douglass) should consider putting this report together.<\/p>\n<p>It was agreed to hold the next NCR-170 meeting at Michigan State University. Officers elected for next year are Rob Templeman (MI), Chair and Bahman Shafii (ID), Secretary. It was tentatively agreed that Arkansas would host the next joint (with USSES) annual meeting in the year 2001. Maryland would host the NCR-170 annual meeting in the year 2002, as per group&#8217;s discussion and agreement.<\/p>\n<p>It was suggested that in our annual meeting minutes we should distinguish between official members and guests. This was favorably agreed upon by the members and suggestion was incorporated starting with this year&#8217;s minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Some &#8220;common theme&#8221; research topics were then considered by the members as potential future projects. It was decided that efforts should be concentrated in two areas. First, members should continue to offer the mixed model workshops at professional meetings and even add to the materials presented by including discussions regarding new software capabilities. Second, members should begin to develop workshops in the area of spatial statistics and offer these materials at various discipline meetings as they have done with the mixed model workshops.<\/p>\n<p>The business meeting was adjourned at 5:30 p.m., July 22, 1999.<\/p>\n<p>The technical meeting continued on July 23 with a presentation by Tim Ellsworth and Stefan Mayer on teaching geostatistics to agriculture and natural resources students. This was followed by a short group discussion. The meeting was adjourned at 10:15 a.m., July 23, 1999.<\/p>\n<p>Submitted by:<\/p>\n<p>_________________________________________<br \/>\nBahman Shafii, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>_________________________________________<br \/>\nDon Bullock, Chair<\/p>\n<p>_________________________________________<br \/>\nJohn Miranowski, Administrative Advisor<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NCR-170: Research Advances in Agricultural Statistics Minutes of the meeting held July 22-23, 1999, Urbana-Champaign, IL Official Members Present: E.
