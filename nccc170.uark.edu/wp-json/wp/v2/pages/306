Statisticians who consult and conduct research in Agriculture Experimental Station environments enable land grant institutions to perform their agricultural research missions more effectively and efficiently than otherwise possible. However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and cannot be, experts in every area of statistics.<\/p>\n<p>NCCC-170 provides research and educational resources that help its members provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers who address national research priorities.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>What has the project done so far?:<\/p>\n<p>\u2219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NCCC-170 has produced a Mixed Model Analysis of Variance Workshop which has been presented at national meetings of several major subject matter societies. In some cases the workshop has been repeated several times at the request of the sponsoring society with attendance limits reached each time. The workshop has also been presented at regional meetings and locally by project members. The workshop has been completely updated since its initial offerings to reflect new approaches and software.<\/p>\n<p>\u2219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NCCC-170 has produced a Spatial Statistics Workshop which has been presented at several national meetings of subject matter societies. The workshop has also been presented at regional and local meetings.<\/p>\n<p>\u2219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NCCC-170 members of the American Society of Agronomy have been instrumental in the development of Section A11 (Biometry). The goal of the Section is to provide a forum for members interested in statistics and experimental design from the research and\/or teaching points of view. It serves as a resource and provides training for the larger Tri-Societies\u2019 membership by sponsoring symposia and workshops at the national and regional meetings.<\/p>\n<p>\u2219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NCCC-170 has served as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. This networking is especially critical for those project members who are the only statistician at their institution.<\/p>\n<p>\u2219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NCCC-170 members have numerous presentations and publications annually which are directly related to their participation in the project.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Impact Statements:<\/p>\n<p>\u2219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Through its workshops for subject matter audiences, NCCC-170 has educated large numbers of researchers in a wide variety of disciplines on the application of the latest developments in mixed model analysis of variance and spatial statistics. For example, the Mixed Model Workshop has been presented to the animal science societies\u2019 annual meetings at their request with the maximum limit of 100 attendees reached on three of five occasions.<\/p>\n<p>\u2219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0NCCC-170 has enabled its members to provide more effective statistical advice and assistance to scientists at their home institutions by improving and broadening their expertise in several areas of statistics critical to agricultural reseach. It has also provided its members with supporting material for educating the next generation of scientists in the use of the latest statistical methods, especially in the areas of mixed models and spatial statistics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Research Needs for Future Impacts:<\/p>\n<p>\u2219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Continue research on the application of statistics to agricultural problems, especially in emerging technologies such as various \u201comics\u201d and precision agriculture which has both spatial and mixed model components.<\/p>\n<p>\u2219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Continue research on software which is able to correctly implement statistical analyses based on newly developed methodology.<\/p>\n<p>\u2219\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Publish a series of papers in a peer reviewed subject matter journal or a monograph or book illustrating new methodology and the correct usage of software to apply it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Contact Information:<\/p>\n<p>John Boyer, Administrative Advisor<\/p>\n<p>jboyer@stat.ksu.edu<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Submission Form for NCRA Impact Statements Research Advances in Agricultural Statistics NCCC-170 &nbsp; Impact Nugget: NCCC-170 fosters research to identify and develop statistical methodology applicable to agricultural research and provides a forum for sharing and educating both statisticians and subject-matter scientists in the agricultural, environmental and natural sciences. &nbsp; Issue: NCCC-170 brings academic, USDA-ARS and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":44,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/306"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/44"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=306"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/306\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/nccc170.uark.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=306"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
