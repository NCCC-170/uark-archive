This year&#8217;s technical program presenters were Linda Young, Rich Alldredge, Bruce Craig, Larry Douglass and Mary Christman. Bruce Craig provided an overview of spatial correlation, spatial regression models and spatial analysis with experimental design. Linda Young presented a case study illustrating various spatial analysis methods including the use of robust estimators for fitting variograms, fitting a variogram in SAS, optimal spatial prediction by kriging and variogram fitting diagnostics. Rich Alldredge followed Linda, describing a long term crop rotation project he is currently working on in Washington state. Larry Douglass&#8217; presentation was on the use of spatial analysis in the context of traditionally designed experiments using the MIXED procedure in SAS. Mary Christman gave a talk describing spatial lattice models and spatial autoregressions. The sessions ended at approximately 5:00 pm.<\/p>\n<p><b>Friday, July 13, 2001:<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The business meeting began at 8:30 am with Ed Gbur presiding.<\/p>\n<p>The first issue at hand was a request from Ken Koonce to decide whether future meetings would be held concurrently with USSES every third year. Several NCR-170 members agreed that this was a satisfactory. Ken proposed that a joint program committee be appointed a year prior to the meeting. No agreement concerning this arrangement was officially made.<\/p>\n<p>Larry Miller spoke about the CSREES Competitive Grant Programs, providing a handout of comparison of available grants.<\/p>\n<p>Cole Gustafson commended Larry Douglass on his work toward completing the renewal proposal for NCR-170. Cole remarked that everyone on the current membership list needs to become an official member. States are encouraged to have more than one participant.<\/p>\n<p>Ed Gbur mentioned that funding for members to travel to meetings is left to the discretion of the experiment station directors. He also posed the question as to whether or not members on the list who are not attending meetings regularly should be dropped from the list. Ed agreed to maintain a low-maintenance website for NCR-170 activities including the membership list, minutes of the meetings, and registration materials for future meetings.<\/p>\n<p>Future meeting sites were decided on. Next year the meeting will be hosted by Maryland with preferred dates of July 11-12 and backup dates of July 15-16. George Fernandez agreed to host the 2003 meeting in Nevada and Ramon Littell agreed to host the 2004 meeting in Florida. The 2004 meeting is proposed to be a joint meeting with USSES.<\/p>\n<p>The sharing of NCR-170 materials and a central repository for such material was discussed. The consensus was that work is not to be shared. Bruce Craig will maintain a repository for Spatial Statistics while Linda Young agreed to do likewise for Mixed Models.<\/p>\n<p>Linda Young and Mary Christman announced that they will present a Spatial Workshop in the D.C. area very soon.<\/p>\n<p>Ed Gbur mentioned that we need to be thinking of new topics for future NCR-170 meetings. Categorical data analysis, data mining and genomics were offered as potential new topics. Ken Koonce suggested group effort projects and materials could be combined to produce a handbook.<\/p>\n<p>After a short coffee break, the meeting continued to determine the objectives for next year&#8217;s meeting. The following sub-projects were established with group leaders listed in boldface.<\/p>\n<p>1. Change of support\/scaling problems (<b>R. Alldredge,<\/b> M. West, J. Zhu)<\/p>\n<p>2. Choice of variogram function (<b>E. Gbur,<\/b> M. Christman, L. Young)<\/p>\n<p>3. Non-stationarity effect and variogram fitting<\/p>\n<p>4. Data driven analysis (<b>L. Douglass,<\/b> T.
