Walt Stroup gave a three part presentation on generalized linear mixed models in agriculture and their analysis using SAS. The morning session presentations were entitled \u201cGLMM\u2019s in agriculture and an introduction to PROC GLIMMIX\u201d and \u201cGLIMMIX: Applications, examples and experiences.\u201d The third part of his presentation entitled \u201cUnresolved GLIMMIX issues and new features in SAS Version 9.2\u201d was presented as the first afternoon session. The final session of the afternoon featured a group discussion of generalized linear models in service courses. The session began with short presentations by Ted Bailey, Ed Gbur and Edzard Van Santen.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On Friday morning Dan Schmoldt was introduced as the new CSREES representative replacing Larry Miller who retired. Prior to a slide presentation about the organizational structure of CREES within the USDA and its partnership with universities, he responded to the previous day\u2019s discussion about statistical involvement in science and education. He encouraged participants to serve on grant review committees for entities like NSF and AES. He noted budget issues and the potential impact of the in-progress farm bill on CREES organization and funding priorities. As he looks to the future, he sees several research areas that are ripe for increased statistical involvement including bioenergy, specialty crops, plant breeding\/genetics, precision agriculture, invasive species, and establishment of log-term agro-ecological research sites.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Dan\u2019s presentation was followed by a group discussion about the linear models and spatial workshops. Discussion centered on whether or not the linear models workshop needed to be updated in include more material on mixed models and generalized linear mixed models. Rob Tempelman said that the animal science societies might be interested again. Entomology would likely be receptive to GLIMMIX modifications dealing with count data. It was generally agreed that the workshop should be updated both in terms of using GLIMMIX and in including material on generalized linear models. Rob, Bruce Craig and Linda Young expressed an interest in working on the update, including modifications to include more material on non-normal responses.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Business meeting: The business meeting was held Friday, July 27 immediately after the first session. Ed Gbur presided. Mark Hinds and Susan Durham were thanked for providing an enjoyable meeting. The following items were discussed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0Next year\u2019s meeting will be held the Ohio State OARDC in Wooster, Ohio on July 21-22. The local arrangements chair will be Bert Bishop and program chair will be Kevin McCarter. Discussion of the 2008 program centered on whether or not it should include sessions on varied topics related to all project objectives; i.e., (i) continuing research in mixed models, (ii) continuing work in spatial statistics, (iii) new technologies, e.g., PLS and remote sensing applications, and (iv) incorporating GLIMMIX into the MIXED workshop and revising the content. The 2009 meeting will be in College Station, Texas hosted by Sara Duke.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0Project members were reminded to send their contributions for the accomplishment, output and impact sections of the annual report to Ed (<a href=\"mailto:egbur@uark.edu\">egbur@uark.edu<\/a>) as soon as possible. The reporting period for this year\u2019s annual report is October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007. The reporting period coincides with the Federal fiscal year. The target completion date for the report is the end of August.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0People who volunteered to contact various societies about workshops reported on their success. Sara Duke approached the Society for Range Management. Although they expressed interest, nothing was finalized. She will try again. Walt Stroup was unsuccessful with the Horticulture Society. Initially there was strong interest but it waned in the face of details such as registration fees to cover presenters\u2019 expenses. In his opinion, they need something more basic than the mixed model or spatial workshops. Rob Tempelman will try Animal Science again. Larry Douglass had agreed to approach the Entomological Society, but he retired and was not at this meeting to report. Linda Young said she would contact the society to determine whether or not they are interested in mixed and\/or spatial workshops. Mary Christman had expected to be in contact with the Wildlife Society but did not attend their annual meeting this year. She will approach them this year, although she anticipates their interest level may be low due to the predominance of non-experimental approaches in wildlife studies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sara Duke raised the question of whether or not we can give CEU credit for our workshops. It is unlikely that we will be able to charge more than needed to recover workshop materials and presenters\u2019 travel costs. She will investigate what would be required and will report to the group at next year\u2019s meeting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Ed asked whether the spatial workshop is not as popular as the mixed workshop or whether we need to push it harder. He noted that some scientists think spatial statistics is about making maps, not statistical analyses. Linda thought that interest in spatial modeling might be strongest in ANOVA-like contexts. Mary noted that we statisticians focus on incorporating spatial covariance in modeling with less emphasis on the statistical component in mapping.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In response to a question about what had happened with the project\u2019s precision agriculture efforts, Mark Hinds commented that commercial solutions are now available and may be all that users feel is needed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(4)\u00a0As the Technical Editor for Crop Science, Don Bullock is soliciting papers to address statistical problems faced by his readers. He envisions a paper, or possibly a series of papers, that outline the transitions from GLM to MIXED to GENMOD\/GLIMMIX. He inquired whether or not project members would be interested in writing such papers as a coherent set. Ed noted that our production of these sorts of papers qualifies as continuing education activities under the project. It was agreed that this type of papers have a reach far beyond that of a workshop. Since the meeting, interested project members have begun to sort out responsibilities for preparing a series of manuscripts.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The meeting adjourned at approximately 10:20 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Accomplishments: Statisticians who consult and do research in an Agricultural Experiment Station environment enable land grant institutions to perform their agricultural research missions more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise be possible. However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and can not be expected to be, experts in every area of statistics. This multi-state committee brings together statisticians to work cooperatively to determine the best current approaches to common statistical problems and to help guide future directions of sound statistical practice. In addition to group outputs such as workshops, it serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would without NCCC-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Outputs:<\/p>\n<p>Workshops:<\/p>\n<p>The spatial statistics workshop was presented to a group of 40 participants at the Joint Meeting of the American Society of Agronomy, the Crop Science Society and the Soil Science Society of America in Indianapolis in November 2006 by Ed Gbur and Mary Christman.

The project is associated with the W1112 regional committee &#8220;Reproductive performance in domestic ruminants&#8221; and was motivated in part by discussions at the 2006 NCCC-170 meetings in Madison, WI.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>A committee has been formed to write a series of papers of a tutorial nature that will describe the basic concepts and issues associated with the analysis of generalized linear mixed models. Numerical examples will be used to illustrate each topic. The committee has outlined five papers and assigned a person or persons to lead the writing for each paper.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Don Bullock and several other project members have incorporated ideas and examples from the annual meetings into the classes which they teach at both the undergraduate and graduate level.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Specific goals for the next three years: (1) Educate project members in statistical issues and methodology related to statistical problems in which large number of variables are collected on relatively few experimental units. Application areas include biotechnology, precision agriculture and chemometrics. (2) Develop additional modules for spatial workshops, refine the current modules and offer versions tailored to specific subject matter audiences. (3) Continue to develop methodology to address both spatial and general statistical problems in the area of precision agriculture. (4) Revise the mixed model workshop to include generalized linear mixed models and the use of new software. (5) Offer the mixed model workshop upon request from subject matter groups.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Impacts:<\/p>\n<p>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to group outputs such as workshops and the planned series of mixed model methods papers, the project serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research.

Project members have begun to offer workshops to their local clientele, the first such offering being to a group of faculty and graduate students in Arkansas. The spatial workshop educates attendees in the fundamental statistical concepts associated with the modeling and analysis of data having a spatial component in a wide variety of situations. The workshop dispels the notion that spatial statistics is the same as GIS map-making.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Publications:<\/p>\n<p>Christman, M.C. and E.N.H. Leone (2007).
