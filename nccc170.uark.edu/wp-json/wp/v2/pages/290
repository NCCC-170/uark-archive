Ed Gbur presided. Ed invited all participants to send him any photographs taken during the meeting for posting on the project web site.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The following items were discussed:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0Rob Tempelman and Bruce Craig were thanked for organizing a productive and enjoyable meeting. Nora Bello was thanked for arranging for remote access by project members.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0The annual report and impact statement are due shortly after the annual meeting. Participants need to send Ed Gbur (<a href=\"mailto:egbur@uark.edu\">egbur@uark.edu<\/a>) accountings of all activities (workshops, papers, presentations, grants, teaching related items, etc.) from October 1, 2012 to September 30, 2013 (or since last year\u2019s report) that are related to or inspired by their participation in NCCC-170 as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0The 2014 meeting will be held at Nebraska with Walt Stroup as host. After some discussion about conflicts with other meetings, the choices were narrowed to July 14-15 or July 18-19. The other option would be the last half of June at a time that did not conflict with the USSES meeting. Bahman Shafii will serve as program chair. The 2015 meeting is tentatively planned as a joint meeting with USSES to be held in Puerto Rico with Raul Macchiavelli serving as the host.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(4)\u00a0The group reviewed progress toward the goals identified at the 2012 meeting. The first goal has been met with the completion of the revision of the mixed model workshop to include generalized linear mixed models and the use of new software. The goal will be removed from the list for next year. Kathy Yeater indicated that the genomics workshop which she and Sara Duke are developing currently covers QTL mapping and association mapping using JMP\/Genomics. They are planning to add a section on Next Gen RNA-Seq gene expression analysis. It was decided that the three remaining goals from this year will be listed again for next year.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(5)\u00a0Bruce Craig and Nora Bello invited project members to become involved in the mixed model workshops presented at the annual Animal Sciences meetings. Presenter costs are covered by the workshop registration fee and the workshops are well attended.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(6)\u00a0The NCCC-170 impact statement from the previous project renewal (2006-2011) edited and designed by Sara Delheimer was reviewed. After much discussion it was decided that more details related to Accomplishments and Needed Research sections should be included in the annual impact statement. It was also suggested that we submit some photographs related to project activities. This was not done previously and as a result, the figures used in the 2006-2011 statement did not directly relate to the project\u2019s accomplishments.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(7)\u00a0The group discussed the issue of remote access participation. The members using remote access at this meeting agreed that it worked acceptably well but was not as desirable as being present. They would not choose remote access if they had the option to be present. Some indicated that they were not as comfortable asking questions during the presentations and missed the in-person interaction with other attendees. Suggestions for improvements included having a moderator, creating an instruction sheet for remote access, and having a training session before the meeting began. The possibility of purchasing a good quality microphone and external speakers was discussed without a final resolution. Members agreed that there should be a reduced registration fee for remote participation if there were costs related to providing such access.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The meeting adjourned at approximately 10:25 a.m. A group photograph for the project web site was taken immediately afterward.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Accomplishments<\/strong>: Statisticians who consult and do research in an Agricultural Experiment Station environment enable land grant institutions to perform their agricultural research missions more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise be possible. However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and can not be expected to be, experts in every area of statistics. This multi-state committee brings together statisticians to work cooperatively to determine the best current approaches to common statistical problems and to help guide future directions of sound statistical practice. In addition to producing group outputs such as workshops, the committee serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would be without NCCC-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Outputs:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Workshops:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kathy Yeater chaired a symposium entitled \u201cStatistical Concepts and Tools to Aid in Publishing Proper Research Conclusions\u201d at the 2012 ASA-CSSA-SSSA meetings in Cincinnati in October, 2012.

The workshop focused on the application of general and generalized linear mixed models to research problems in the animal and food sciences. There were approximately 80 participants of whom 40% returned the workshop survey. The written comments indicated that participants felt that the presenters were well prepared and informative. They found the data driven example approach helpful for them to be able to apply the material to their own research. 86% of the respondents gave the workshop a rating of 8 or higher on a 1 to 10 scale.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Linda Young and Kenneth Lopiano presented a workshop entitled \u201cChange of Support: Statistical Issues and Methods\u201d to the US-International Association for Landscape Ecology in April, 2012 in Newport, Rhode Island.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mark West presented \u201cMixed Model Analysis for a Real Data Set\u201d as part of a workshop \u201cR for Recovering SAS Users \u2013 Introduction to the Statistical Software Package R\u201d at the ASA-CSSA-SSSA Meeting in Cincinnati on October, 2012.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rob Tempelman presented a workshop entitled &#8220;Introduction to SAS for Statistical Analysis of Research Data&#8221; for faculty, staff, and graduate students at Michigan State University, September, 2012.

This two-year grant from the professional society beginning November 1, 2013 will expand statistics workshops and training opportunities from the usual one-time event at Annual Meetings to Specialty\/Regional meetings and a web-based platform. NCCC-170 members including Walt Stroup, Nora Bello, Bruce Craig, Kathy Yeater and Sara Duke will assist with the development of initial workshop topics such as sample size and power calculations, mixed models for normal and non-normal data, and multivariate analysis applications.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>John Stevens is a co-investigator on a grant entitled &#8220;Genome reprogramming and embryo survivability in porcine somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos&#8221; funded by the USDA under the AFRI Foundational Program. The award period is August 2013 &#8211; July 2016. Using statistical bioinformatics tools John has learned and refined through discussions with members of the NCCC-170 group, he will help the principal investigators consider a novel, noninvasive means to evaluate reprogramming efficiency and survivability in porcine embryos produced using somatic cell nuclear transfer. Application of this bioassay could significantly enhance the efficiency of reproductive cloning by nuclear transfer in agriculturally relevant species.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Bruce Craig continues to use portions of the material from the NCCC-170 linear and generalized linear mixed model workshops in his course entitled &#8220;Statistical consulting and collaboration&#8221; in the Department of Statistics at Purdue University.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Bahram Momen teaches a graduate course in Experimental Design and Advanced Statistical Analysis at the University of Maryland attended by students from the University as well as other educational and research institutions in the Washington D.C. area. The course content, particularly the laboratory component, has been influenced by his association with NCCC-170. The statistical consulting component of his faculty appointment has also been enhanced by his participation in the project.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Specific goals for the next three years: (1) Offer the mixed model and generalized linear mixed model workshops upon request from subject matter groups. (2) Develop a workshop on data analysis techniques for genomics researchers. (3) Educate project members in statistical issues and methodology related to statistical problems in which large numbers of variables are collected on relatively few experimental units. Application areas include biotechnology, precision agriculture and chemometrics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Impacts:<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0NCCC-170 fosters research to identify and develop statistical methodology applicable to agricultural research and provides a forum for sharing and educating both statisticians and subject-matter scientists in the agricultural, environmental and natural sciences. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would be without NCCC-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0Project members provide continuing education for scientists in agriculturally related disciplines in modern statistical analyses of designed experiments in general and specifically in the areas of generalized linear mixed models and statistical techniques in genomics applications. Examples of such activities and their immediate impacts for the current reporting period are listed in the Accomplishments section of this report.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0Project members collaborate in research projects with scientists in agricultural related disciplines to develop and use proper statistical design and analysis methodology well beyond standard textbook applications. These efforts often result in competitive grant participation and refereed publications.
