Shafii, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>The meeting opened on the morning of July 11, 1996 with program remarks from Chairperson Wyman Nyquist, followed by a welcome by Bill Baumgardt, Director, Agricultural Research Programs, Purdue University. This was the technical portion of the program with a total of 35 participants.<\/p>\n<p>The featured speaker was Peter McCullagh from the University of Chicago. He presented a talk entitled &#8220;Generalized Linear Models: An Overview.&#8221; This was followed by a presentation given by Gregory Goodwin from the SAS Institute. He discussed the usage of the SAS Software in fitting generalized linear models. The afternoon session of the technical program was also devoted to additional presentations by members. Paul Cornelius provided some simple PROC GENMOD examples, while Larry Douglass presented an application of generalized linear models to agricultural data. Rob Tempelman gave a Bayesian implementation of generalized linear mixed models in animal science, and Don Bullock presented a restriction-error approach to design and analysis of experiments.<\/p>\n<p>The technical meeting of July 11 started at 8:35 a.m. and ended at 4:45 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>The morning of July 12 was used for the continuation of the technical program as well as a business meeting. Two more presentations were made in the early morning hours. Jeffrey Lucas gave a presentation regarding repeated observations of dichotomous choice, and Brian Yandell led a discussion on the content of &#8220;on-farm trials&#8221; workshop. Members were urged to submit materials relevant to on-farm trials (design and analysis) to Brian by November, 1996. He would then collect, organize and maintain the specified information on the World Wide Web. The technical session of the program ended at 9:50 a.m.<\/p>\n<p>The business meeting started at 10:20 a.m. Wyman Nyquist chaired the session. It was agreed to hold the next NCR-170 meeting in Logan, Utah. Officers elected for next year are Don Sisson (UT), Chair and Bahman Shafii (ID), Secretary. A tentative date of July 10-11, 1997 was agreed upon by the members.<\/p>\n<p>The subject of continuing the NCR-170 project was brought up (note: the project is due to expire September 30, 1997). After some group discussion and following remarks from the administrative advisor, Linda Young moved to continue the NCR-170 project. The members collectively voted in favor of the motion. It was further agreed that Linda Young (Chair), Rick Nordheim, and George Milliken serve on a committee to revise the project. Members were urged to communicate their thoughts and suggestions regarding the justification of the project to George Milliken.<\/p>\n<p>Some members suggested coordinating efforts with USSES (SRIEG-13) and the possibility of joint meetings. Bahman Shafii moved to keep NCR-170 separate (to meet only periodically with USSES). The motion was passed favorably by the members,<\/p>\n<p>The theme for next year&#8217;s meeting was agreed to be mixed models. Larry Douglass and George Milliken agreed to prepare and conduct a workshop on mixed models next year in Logan, Utah.<\/p>\n<p>Susanne Aref and Don Bullock agreed to serve as tentative hosts for the NCR-170 meeting in Urbana, Illinois in 1998.<\/p>\n<p>The meeting was adjourned at 12:15 p.m., July 12, 1996.<\/p>\n<p>Submitted by:<\/p>\n<p>_______________________________________<br \/>\nBahman Shafii, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>_______________________________________<br \/>\nWyman Nyquist, Chair<\/p>\n<p>_______________________________________<br \/>\nDon Holt, Administrative Advisor<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NCR-170: Research Advances in Agricultural Statistics Minutes of the meeting held July 11-12, 1996, West Lafayette, IN Members and\/or friends present: E.
