Shafii, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>The meeting opened on the morning of August 5, 1998 with program remarks from the host Mark Payton, followed by a welcome by D.C. Coston, Associate Director of the Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Station. This was the second joint meeting of the NCR-170 with USSES (the first joint meeting: July 13-14, 1995, Fort Collins, CO), with a total of 33 participants. While the technical program included members from both groups, it was agreed that each group would hold a separate business meeting.<\/p>\n<p>The theme of this year&#8217;s meeting was mixed models. Susanne Aref, Ted Baily and Larry Douglas presented various portions of a mixed model short course prepared for the National Agronomy Meetings by the NCR-170 members. Representatives from both groups offered comments and suggestions for improvement of the short course. This was followed by a presentation given by George Milliken entitled: &#8220;A Look at PROC MIXED in SAS Version 7&#8221;. Arnold Saxton also presented a talk on &#8220;TVAAS: Mixed Models in Public Education&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The technical meeting of August 6 started at 8:35 a.m. and ended at 4:30 p.m.<\/p>\n<p>The morning of August 7 was used for the continuation of the technical program as well as a business meeting. Bob Rodriguez of SAS Institute presented some of the enhancements and changes in SAS Version 7 and JMP. The groups briefly discussed future planning and direction. It was agreed that Arkansas would host the next joint meeting of NCR-170 and USSES in the year 2001. The groups then separated for their respective business meetings.<\/p>\n<p>The business meeting started at 10:05 a.m. Don Bullock chaired the session. It was agreed to hold the next NCR-170 meeting at the University of Illinois. No specific date was determined; however, it was decided to schedule the meeting for mid to late July. Officers elected for next year are Don Bullock (IL), Chair, and Bahman Shafii (ID), Secretary. It was tentatively agreed that Michigan would host the NCR-170 annual meeting in the year 2000. Arkansas would host the next joint meeting in the year 2001, as per groups&#8217; discussion and agreement.<\/p>\n<p>John Miranowski commented on the renewal process for NCR-170. Some of the requirements were reviewed and members were urged to document\/publish the group&#8217;s achievements before the specified renewal period. Members agreed that the mixed model short course, the product of group&#8217;s effort for the past two years, was an important and attractive topic for renewal considerations. The short course will be given this year at the Agronomy Meetings in Baltimore, and could potentially be presented at other professional society meetings such as entomology, horticulture and animal sciences in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Brian Yandell announced that he would be the chair of the ASA Consulting Section for the year 2000. He then asked NCR-170 members for ideas and topics to be included as part of the program (Special Contributed Paper Sessions) for the Joint Statistical Meetings.<\/p>\n<p>Some &#8220;common theme&#8221; research topics were then considered by the members as potential future projects. These included: spatial statistics, design of experiments and robust regression. In addition, some members indicated their interest in continuing to bring representatives from SAS Institute to provide presentations on current software developments. After a brief discussion, it was agreed that topics in spatial statistics and current GIS software will be explored. Members were urged to communicate their interest, choice of topic(s), and suggestions on potential speakers to Don Bullock.<\/p>\n<p>John Miranowski suggested that the group should consider electing a Vice Chair each year (NCR-170 Officers currently include a Chairperson, usually the host, and a secretary). Members collectively agreed to consider this suggestion for the next year&#8217;s election. It was further agreed to consider nominations and reelection for the office of Secretary.<\/p>\n<p>The meeting was adjourned at 11:00 a.m., August 7, 1998.<\/p>\n<p>Submitted by:<\/p>\n<p>______________________________________<br \/>\nBahman Shafii, Secretary<\/p>\n<p>______________________________________<br \/>\nDon Bullock, Chair<\/p>\n<p>______________________________________<br \/>\nJohn Miranowski, Administrative Advisor<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>NCR-170: Research Advances in Agricultural Statistics Minutes of the meeting held August 6-7, 1998, Oklahoma City, OK Members present: E.
