Kathy Yeater, Kevin McCarter (SCC-013 program chair), Ted Bailey and David Meek were thanked for organizing a productive and enjoyable meeting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The following items were discussed:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0The 2011 meeting will be held at Purdue and hosted by Bruce Craig. The date was set for July 7-8. John Stevens will serve as program chair. Rob Tempelman volunteered to host the 2012 meeting at Michigan State.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0The group reviewed and discussed specific goals for the next three years and impact statements. The annual report and impact statement are due shortly after the annual meeting. Participants need to send Ed (<a href=\"mailto:egbur@uark.edu\">egbur@uark.edu<\/a>) accountings of all activities (workshops, papers, presentations, teaching related, etc.) from October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2010 (or since last year\u2019s report) that are related to or inspired by their participation in NCCC-170 as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0Mary Christman, Kevin McCarter and Walt Stroup will present a workshop on generalized linear mixed models and will participate in a related symposium organized by Kathy Yeater at the ASA-CSSA-SSSA annual meeting in Long Beach in November. Workshops have been offered several times at the Animal and Dairy Science Societies annual meetings. Tentative plans are to do so again. Approaching other professional societies to offer workshops was discussed. The possible use of a webinar format was also mentioned.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(4)\u00a0Following the discussion at last year\u2019s annual meeting, the American Society of Agronomy was contacted and agreed to publish a book on generalized linear mixed models written by project members and participants. The project members involved in the writing are Mary Christman, Susan Durham, Ed Gbur, Matt Kramer, Kevin McCarter, Walt Stroup, Mark West and Linda Young. The manuscript is due to the publishers by October 1, 2010. Ed gave a brief progress report. Six of the seven chapters have been through at least one draft and revision. Outside reviewers have been lined up. George Milliken asked about the possibility of sharing the material with group members. Kathy Yeater volunteered to set up a Sharepoint web site. Ed will check with the Agronomy Society to see if this would be permissible under the contract.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(5)\u00a0The current project is scheduled to end in September, 2011. The renewal process must be completed this Fall. Projects must make a special request to keep the same number. Otherwise a new number will be assigned. Current members will not automatically be rolled over into the new project. Everyone must submit a new Appendix E form. John Boyer agreed to continue to serve as our Administrative Advisor. Deadlines are as follows.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>September 15\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Initial request due.

However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and can not be expected to be, experts in every area of statistics. This multi-state committee brings together statisticians to work cooperatively to determine the best current approaches to common statistical problems and to help guide future directions of sound statistical practice. In addition to group outputs such as workshops, it serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would without NCCC-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Outputs:<\/p>\n<p>Workshops:<\/p>\n<p>George Milliken presented a half day work shop entitled &#8220;Mixed models analysis using SAS&#8221; at the 11th Scientific Conference of Sub-Saharan Africa Network of the International Biometric Society in August, 2009 at Kabarak University, Nakuru, Kenya.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Larry Madden presented a half-day workshop entitled \u201cRegression Analysis with SAS\u201d at the Annual Meeting of the American Phytopathological Society in Portland OR in August 2009.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rob Tempelman presented a half-day workshop entitled \u201cMixed model analysis of research data\u201d for the Center for Statistical Consulting and Training at Michigan State University (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cstat.msu.edu)\">www.cstat.msu.edu<\/a>) in December, 2009.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rob Tempelman presented workshop lectures at the 10th International Microarray Workshop (<a href=\"(http:\/\/ag.arizona.edu\/microarray\/workshopJan2010.html)\">http:\/\/ag.arizona.edu\/microarray\/workshopJan2010.html)<\/a> on experimental design, data normalization and statistical inference in January, 2010.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Linda Young presented workshops entitled \u201cApplied linear and generalized linear mixed models\u201d to the San Diego Chapter of the American Statistical Association and the El Paso Chapter of the American Statistical Association in April, 2010.
