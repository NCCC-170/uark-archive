Technical presentations in the morning session were given by Jun Zhu (\u201cStatistical modeling of spatial-temporal data in a forest entomology study\u201d) and George Fernandez (\u201cA SAS macro application for all possible model selection in PROC MIXED\u201d). Presentations in the afternoon session were given by Dan Nettleton (\u201cMicroarray experimental design and analysis\u201d), Roxana Alexandridis (\u201cA unified approach to discover and classify tumor types using microarray data\u201d), Rob Tempelman (\u201cHierarchical modeling of microarray data\u201d) and David Meek (\u201cSignal processing analysis using discrete Fourier transforms\u201d). The afternoon session ended at approximately 5:00 p.m. On Friday morning after the business meeting, Walt Stroup made the final techical presentation entitled \u201cInitial experiences with SAS Proc GLIMMIX.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Business meeting: The business meeting began at 9:00 a.m. on Friday, July 14 with Ed Gbur presiding. Jun Zhu and Don Bullock were thanked for providing an enjoyable meeting. The following items were discussed.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0Next year\u2019s meeting tentatively will be held jointly with USSES in Utah. The local arranagements chair will be Susan Durham and the program chair will be Mark Hinds. After some discussion it was decided to have the meeting on July 26-27 instead of the ususal mid-July dates because the Joint Statistics Meetings will be July 29-August 2 in Salt Lake City. It was felt that the later meeting date would help with travel costs for those attending JSM. The 2008 meeting was scheduled for Ohio.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0Ed Gbur reported that the project has been renewed until 2011. The current project ends on September 30 and the new project will begin on October 1. Final reports are no longer required since now the Directors use the set of annual reports, especially the accomplishments and impacts as they relate to our objectives, as the basis of their evaluation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0Project members were reminded to send their contributions for the accomplishment, output and impact sections of the annual report to Ed (<a href=\"mailto:egbur@uark.edu\">egbur@uark.edu<\/a>) as soon as possible. The reporting period for this year\u2019s report is July 2005 through September 2006. In the future, reporting periods will coincide with the Federal fiscal year. The target completion date for the report is mid-August to avoid the beginning of fall semester.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In the past, items have included publications (refereed and non-refereed), presentations (indicate if invited), workshops, grants, consulting projects, organization of sessions at meetings, teaching (for their effect on future scientists) and awards received. The annual report has a section entitled &#8220;Accomplishments and Impacts.&#8221; The accomplishment part is straightforward. Impacts are a bit more difficult so any input as to the impact of what you are reporting would be very much appreciated.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(4)\u00a0Don Bullock presented a report on his efforts to offer the spatial workshop at the annual meetings of various subject matter disciplines. He contacted the plant pathologists, entomologists, agricultural engineers and agronomists. As a result of his efforts, the workshop will be presented at the plant pathology annual meetings on July 29 in Quebec by Bruce Craig and Murray Clayton. Don believes that we will be approved for the 2007 agronomy meetings but was unsuccessful this year with the entomologists and agricultural engineers. He offered the following lessons that he learned this year about scheduling workshops:<\/p>\n<p>(a)\u00a0\u00a0Subject matter groups are interested in our workshops.<\/p>\n<p>(b)\u00a0Find the right person to communicate with and keep the lines of communication open. Don\u2019t assume that the other person will take care of all of the details if you don\u2019t touch base with them regularly throughout the selection and scheduling process.<\/p>\n<p>(c)\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that reimbursement arrangements are understood by all parties in advance.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Discussion then turned to future workshop offerings. It was noted that regional society meetings might be easier to deal with than national meetings and that it may take more than one try before being successful. It was also decided that the mixed model workshop would continue to be offered if organizations are interested. Walt Stroup suggested that ASA chapter meetings which target graduate students and M.S. level statisticians working outside of academics might be another place to do our workshops. John Boyer agreed to mention the availability of our workshops at the Council of Chapters meeting at JSM. Walt also suggested that agriculturally oriented social science groups might be interested in our workshops.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The following people agreed to contact subject matter groups about our mixed model and spatial workshops: Sara Duke \u2013 Society of Range Management; Walt Stroup \u2013 horticulture; Rob Tempelman \u2013 animal sciences; Susan Durham \u2013 ecology; Larry Douglass \u2013 entomology; Don Bullock \u2013 agronomy. Mary Christman will be contacted to check on the wildlife societies.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(5)\u00a0The group discussed the focus on the new project since the new objective as described in the renewal request was very broad. Ed Gbur suggested that our group is large enough to have two separate topics related to the objective. The consensus of the members was that the two topics are genomics and generalized linear mixed models. Next year\u2019s program should reflect both topics if possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The meeting adjourned at approximately 10:15 a.m. and was followed by the last presentation on the technical program.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Accomplishments and impacts: Statisticians who consult and do research in an Agricultural Experiment Station environment enable land grant institutions to perform their agricultural research missions more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise be possible. However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and can not be expected to be, experts in every area of statistics. This multi-state committee brings together statisticians to work cooperatively to determine the best current approaches to common statistical problems and to help guide future directions of sound statistical practice. In addition to group outputs such as workshops, it serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would without NCR-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Outputs:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Workshops:<\/p>\n<p>The spatial statistics workshop was presented to a group of 40 participants at the Joint Meeting of the American Phytopathological Society, the Canadian Phytopathological Society and the Mycological Society of America in Quebec on July 2006 by Bruce Craig and Murray Clayton. The workshop is also scheduled to be presented at the Tri-Societies (ASA-CSSA-SSSA) annual meeting in November 2006.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>David Meek presented two in-house mixed model workshops at the National Soil Tilth Laboratory in December 2005 and February 2006.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>USDA-ARS statisticans at Beltsville organized and co-hosted a two day spatial statistics workshop with USGS and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in March 2006. The impetus for the workshop came in part from the interaction between NCCC-170 and the ARS statisticians, some of whom are project members. In addition, the following presentations were made by project members:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Mary Christman. Lattice models with spatial dependencies \u2013 An introduction.<\/p>\n<p>Jun Zhu.

He used a variety of ideas discussed at NCCC-170 meetings as part of the course materials.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Specific goals for the next three years: (1) Educate project members in statistical issues and methodology related to statistical problems in which large number of variables are collected on relatively few experimental units. Application areas include biotechnology, precision agriculture and chemometrics. (2) Develop additional modules for spatial workshops, refine the current modules and offer versions tailored to specific subject matter audiences. (3) Continue to develop methodology to address both spatial and general statistical problems in the area of precision agriculture. (4) Continue to offer the mixed model workshop upon request from subject matter groups.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Publications:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Aukema, B.H., A.L. Carroll, J. Zhu, K.F.
