Ed Gbur presided. Ed invited all participants to send him any photographs taken during the meeting for posting on the project web site. Jerry Oglesby will check with the speakers about posting their presentations on the project website.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The following items were discussed:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(1)\u00a0Ed announced that John Boyer has retired from Kansas State and resigned as our Administrative Advisor. Bruce Craig has been appointed as our new Administrative Advisor.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(2)\u00a0The annual report and impact statement are due shortly after the annual meeting. Participants need to send Ed (<a href=\"mailto:egbur@uark.edu\">egbur@uark.edu<\/a>) accountings of all activities (workshops, papers, presentations, grants, teaching related items, etc.) from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012 (or since last year\u2019s report) that are related to or inspired by their participation in NCCC-170 as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(3)\u00a0The 2013 annual meeting will be held during the last week of June to avoid conflicts with the July 4 holiday and the Animal Sciences annual meetings the week after that. Rob Tempelman will host the meeting at Michigan State and serve as local arrangements chair. Bruce Craig will serve as program chair. The tentative site for the 2014 meeting is Nebraska with Walt Stroup as host. The 2015 meeting is tentatively planned as a joint meeting with USSES to be held in Puerto Rico with Raul Macchiavelli serving as the host.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(4)\u00a0Ed Gbur reported that the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) book was published in January 2012 by the American Society of Agronomy. The title is \u201cAnalysis of Generalized Linear Mixed Models in the Agricultural and Natural Resources Sciences\u201d and can be purchased directly from the Society or on Amazon. The book had sold 312 copies as of July 6. Project members involved in the writing were Mary Christman, Susan Durham, Ed Gbur, Matt Kramer, Kevin McCarter, Walt Stroup, Mark West and Linda Young.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(5)\u00a0The group reviewed progress toward the goals identified at the 2011 meeting. The first goal has been met with the publication of the GLMM book. Nora Bello and Bruce Craig have extensively revised the mixed model workshop to include a section on GLMMs and have introduced the use of PROC GLIMMIX. Attention turned to the specific goals for the next three years. Discussion about expanding the information on generalized linear mixed models in the mixed models workshop led to a proposal to break the workshop into two components, one focusing on linear mixed models and the other on GLMMs. A new goal was added to create a workshop on data analysis for genomics researchers. The effort would be led by Kathy Yeater and Sara Duke.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(6)\u00a0Bruce and Nora invited project members to become involved in the mixed model workshops presented at the annual Animal Sciences meetings. Presenter costs are covered by the workshop registration fee and the workshops are well attended. Following up on the discussion of breaking the workshop into two components, Walt Stroup suggested that a workshop for the Animal Sciences meetings be presented annually, alternating between linear mixed and generalized linear mixed models. Several members expressed interest in participating.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>(7)\u00a0Kathy Yeater reported that the Biometry and Statistical Computing Section of the American Society of Agronomy is collaborating with the <i>Agronomy Journal<\/i> Statistics Committee to put together an invited series of eleven papers on statistical topics that would be compiled into a special publications monograph. Several NCCC-170 members including Kathy Yeater, Sara Duke and Walt Stroup have been asked to contribute to the collection on the topics of multivariate analysis and non-normal data, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>The meeting adjourned at approximately 10:50 a.m. A group photograph for the project web site was taken immediately afterward.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Accomplishments:<\/strong> Statisticians who consult and do research in an Agricultural Experiment Station environment enable land grant institutions to perform their agricultural research missions more effectively and efficiently than would otherwise be possible. However, most stations have at most one or two professional statisticians who are not, and can not be expected to be, experts in every area of statistics. This multi-state committee brings together statisticians to work cooperatively to determine the best current approaches to common statistical problems and to help guide future directions of sound statistical practice. In addition to producing group outputs such as workshops, the committee serves as a resource for its members and a sounding board for new ideas in their applied statistical research. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would be without NCCC-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Outputs:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Workshops:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Walt Stroup and Matt Kramer presented a workshop entitled \u201cIntroduction to Generalized Linear Mixed Models for Horticultural Research\u201d at the American Society of Horticultural Sciences in Wailoloa, HI in September 2011.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Rob Tempelman presented an invited workshop entitled \u201cQuantitative Genetic Inference in Generalized Linear Mixed Models\u201d for INTA (Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria), Buenos Aires, Argentina in October 2011.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sara Duke and Kathy Yeater along with colleagues at SAS Institute planned and facilitated two 3-day training workshops entitled \u201cLinkage Mapping and Association Mapping using JMP Genomics Software.\u201d The first was for oat researchers and was held in College Station, TX in October 2011.

Frenzel successfully defended his work in July 2012.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Walt Stroup taught a reading class entitled \u201cR and SAS as tools for GLMM analysis &#8211; a comparison\u201d to University of Nebraska Statistics PhD students using examples from his generalized linear mixed model book and the generalized linear mixed model book by Gbur et al. The students compared implementation of the analysis of the examples using R and SAS\u2019s PROC GLMMIX. They presented a seminar to the department as part of their course work and a draft summary of their findings was distributed to NCCC170 &amp; SCC-13 members at the joint 2012 meeting.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Walt Stroup is the Principal Investigator on an NSF Research, Evaluation and Technical Assistance (RETA) Grant entitled \u201cData Connections\u201d whose purpose is to develop value-added models to characterize the impact of Math-Science Partnerships on K-12 student learning in Math and Science. Value-added models are mixed models whose roots go back to Bill Sanders\u2019 work with S-189 (the project that led to SAS\u2019s PROC MIXED). There is a close interconnection between value-added models for education and mixed models in genomics. The models that he is working on in the RETA grant will also contribute to the University of Nebraska\u2019s strategic plan objective to \u201cCreate a knowledgeable workforce with significant intellectual capacity within scientific fields that drive the economic progress and productivity of the agbioscience industry.\u201d Walt attributes his generalized linear mixed model work with NCCC-170 and S-189 as a big factor in obtaining the grant.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Specific goals for the next three years<\/strong>: (1) Complete the revision of the mixed model workshop to include generalized linear mixed models and the use of new software. (2) Offer the mixed model and generalized linear mixed model workshops upon request from subject matter groups. (3) Develop a workshop on data analysis techniques for genomics researchers. (4) Educate project members in statistical issues and methodology related to statistical problems in which large number of variables are collected on relatively few experimental units. Application areas include biotechnology, precision agriculture and chemometrics.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Impacts:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>NCCC-170 fosters research to identify and develop statistical methodology applicable to agricultural research and provides a forum for sharing and educating both statisticians and subject-matter scientists in the agricultural, environmental and natural sciences. As a result, all members are able to provide more effective assistance to agricultural researchers addressing national research priorities than they would be without NCCC-170.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Publications:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bangarwa, S.K., J.K.
